Foundations before working on projects

- Learn about how data should be stored on disks (FAT32, NTFS, ext4, APFS)

- Understand what it means by "deleted" means at a storgate level (data is often still there until overwritten)

- Grasp RAM vs disk vs cache - knowing what kind of evidence can live where.

- Study chain of custody and evidence handling (this is so i can relfect real forensic workflow)
