Formatting Tips

- Use headdings and tables to organize
- Keep hashes and filenames in monospaced font for clarity
- Keep formatting consistent (expecially dates, hash types)
- Avoid speculation - stick to facts and supported findings
- Use timestamps in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
- Store your document as PDF (to lock formatting) and archive it with your case folder
