Ram (Random Access Memory)

What is it:

- Volatile memory used by the CPU for active processes.

- Data is lost when the power if off.

- Extremely fast compared disks.

What kind of evidence lives in here:

- Open documents, browser sessions, chat messages in memory.

- Encryption keys or passwords stored temporarily by programs.

Network session data (packets in buffers).

Key forensics note:

- Ram is ephemeral - if you shut down the machine, it's gone.

- Tools like Volatility or Rekall can dump RAM for analysis.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Disk (HDD/SS, presistent storage)

What it is:

- Non-volatile storage - keeps data when powered off.

- Slower than RAM buy huge in capacity.

What kind of evidence lives here:

- Files, folders, emails, logs, database.

- Deleted files (until overwritten).

- Installed software, system logs, browser history, artifacts.

File system matters:

- NTFS, ext4, APFS, FAT32 all store data differently.

- Deleted data may lingers.

Key forensics note:

- Most traditional forensic evidence comes from disks.

- Disk imaging is common: creates a bit-for-bit copy for analysis.

Cache (CPU, dis, browser, etc.)

What it is:

- Small, fast storage used to temporarily speed up access.

- Examples: CPU L1/L2/L3 cache, disk cache, browser cache.

- Often volatile like RAM, but sometimes written to disk.

What kind of evidence lives here:

- Recent computations in CPU cache (rare to access in practice).

- Browser cache: copies of web pages, images, scripts.

- Disk cache: recentl read/written files may be stored temporarily for speed.

Key forensics note:

- Cache can hold transient evidence that never makes it to disk.

- CPU cache is usually impractical to capture in standard investigations.
