What is Chain of Custody (CoC)?

Definition:

- A documented and unbroken record showing who collected, handled, transferred, analyzed, or stored evidence from the moment it was discovered until it is presented in court.

Purpose:

- Ensure integrity and authenticity of evidence.

- Prove that evidence hasn't been tampered with, altered, or replaced.

Key Principles of Evidence Handling

Identification:

- Clearly mark what is evidence (file, USB, disk, RAM dump).

- Assign a unique identifier or case number.

Collection:

- Use forensically sound methods (disk imaging with dd or FTK Imager).

- Avoid altering the original device - idenally, work on bit-for-bit copies.

Preservation:

- Keep evidence in secure containers (bags, lockers, or encrypted storage).

- Maintain write-protection for disks, avoid booting from the target machine if possible.

Documentation

- Record who handled it, when, where, and what was done.

- Log each action with timestamps.

Transfer

- When moving evidence between people or locations, update the chain of custody log.

- Ensure sealed packaging and signatures to confirm integrity.

Analysis

- Always analyze copies, NEVER originals.

- Document all tools, commands, and methods used.

Storage

- Evidence should be stored securely(locked cabinets, restricted access, environmental control).

- Maintain proper labeling and logs until legal proceedings conclude.

Chain of Custody Form Example

| Item ID | Description               | Collected By | Date/Time        | Location    | Transfer/Action      | Received By | Signature |
| ------- | ------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------- | ----------- | -------------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| USB001  | USB drive containing logs | Officer A    | 10/06/2025 14:30 | Crime scene | Sealed & transported | Officer B   | âœ…         |

Key Points to Remember for Forensics

- Original evidence should never be modified.

- Every handoff must be logged.

- Digital evidence is fragile: even copying RAM or disk incorrectly can break integrity.

- Hashing (MD5, SHA-256) is used to verify evidence hasn't changed.

Example workflow:

- Arrive at a scene -> Identify & seize computer

- Photograph & document -> Label as evidence

- Place in Faraday bag or write-protect drive

- Transport to lab -> Log transfer in CoC form

- Make bit-for-bit copy -> Analyze copy

- Keep original untouched -> Secure storage

- Present findings -> CoC form shows integrity
